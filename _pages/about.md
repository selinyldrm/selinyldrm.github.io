👋 Hello, I’m Selin (ce-line) — a computer science researcher driven by ever-lasting curiosity and caffeine.

🔍 My research efforts intersect at efficient Generative AI and high-performance Machine Learning systems, where I have been exploring bringing state-of-the-art Large Language Model inference to resource-constrained GPUs. Particularly, I’m interested in optimizing speculative decoding algorithms on GPUs. My doctoral advisor is [Dr. Deming Chen](https://dchen.ece.illinois.edu/). 

💻 I’ve had the privilege of interning at top-tier industry leaders, including NVIDIA, where I have made significant contributions to deep learning optimization libraries. In Summer 2025, I have joined AMD's Generative AI Research Team in California as PhD scholar, working on speculative decoding for image generation.

📚 I earned my undergraduate degree in Computer Science at Middle East Technical University (METU) in Turkey, where my research was recognized with the second-place award in department-level undergraduate research competition.

💡 Fun Fact: My name means strong flowing water in Turkish and is also analogous to the mythological goddess of the Moon (a.k.a Selene)!

📩 If you’re into relevant research topics, open-source science, or academic memes, please feel free to reach out to me!
