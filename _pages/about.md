Hello, I’m Selin — a computer science researcher driven by ever-lasting curiosity and caffeine!

My advisor is [Dr. Deming Chen](https://dchen.ece.illinois.edu/). My research interests intersect at efficient Generative Ai and high-performance Machine Learning systems, where I currently explore bringing state-of-the-art Large Language Model inference to resource-constrained GPUs. I’m particularly interested in optimizing speculative decoding branch of language generation and its GPU-specific optimizations. In addition to academic research, I’ve had the privilege of working at top-tier industry leaders, including NVIDIA, where I learned to bridge theory with real-world deployment by teaming up with talented people.

I believe in research that is meticulous, reproducible, and strive for ground-breaking results. My career is fueled by a passion for learning, a healthy dose of skepticism, and an ever-growing list of half-baked ideas in a Google Doc labeled “someday.”

If you’re into relevant research topics, open-source science, or academic memes, please feel free to reach out!
