Hello, I’m Selin — a computer science researcher driven by ever-lasting curiosity and caffeine.

Fun Fact: My name means strong flowing water and is derived from the mythological goddess of the Moon (a.k.a Selene) in Turkish. Feel free to pronounce as "Ce"-"leen"!

My research efforts intersect at efficient Generative Ai and high-performance Machine Learning systems, where I currently explore bringing state-of-the-art Large Language Model inference to resource-constrained GPUs. I’m particularly interested in optimizing speculative decoding subfield of language generation and its GPU-specific optimizations. My doctoral advisor is [Dr. Deming Chen](https://dchen.ece.illinois.edu/). 

I’ve had the privilege of working at top-tier industry leaders, including NVIDIA, where I learned to bridge theory with real-world deployment by teaming up with talented people. In 2025 Summer, I will be working as part of AMD's Research Team working on Generative Ai in California.

I believe in research that is meticulous, reproducible, and I strive for ground-breaking results. My career is fueled by a passion for learning, a healthy dose of skepticism, and an ever-growing list of half-baked ideas in a Google Doc labeled “someday.”
